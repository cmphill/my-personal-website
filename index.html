            <p>Hello, my name is Cooper. I went to College of the Ozarks and studied psychology because I wasn't sure what to major in. I planned on going to law school afterward, but I realized it wasn't for me. I worked for 3 years and wasn't sure of my next steps. I have always loved computers and decided to do something with that. I got the CompTIA A+ certification. After doing that, I realized I wanted to learn software development. Flatiron came up as one of the top schools. Here I am, having enrolled in Flatiron. I am excited for what the future holds! </p>
